Hello! My name is Rangon Roy Utsab. I am currently pursuing **B.Sc.(Engg.)** at Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University in **Computer Science and Engineering**.

My primary interest lies in the application of machine learning algorithms to solve real-life problems efficiently.

As my pastime activities, I do stuffs like solving CTF and competitive programming challenges and playing video games. I am an avid enjoyer of classical and indie music.
